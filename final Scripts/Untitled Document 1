If the version of the chrome driver and browser changes, search for the new version of web browser in the about section and download the respective chrome driver associated with the browser which will be an .exe file. 
Place the chrome.exe file in the same folder where the Python files are located.

To create an .exe of the python files, install Python and pip and run command:
1. pip install pyinstaller
2. pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "./requirements.txt:." --add-data "./chrome.exe:." meesho.py

The above command will create a "dist" folder which will contain the prepare .exe file for the meesho.py script.
